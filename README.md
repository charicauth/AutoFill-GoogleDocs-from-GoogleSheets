# Auto-Fill-Google-Docs-from-Google-Sheets
This is a program written with Google Apps Script to take input from a Google Sheet and fill out a Google Docs template.
I'm currently using it to input information about job postings into the spreadsheet and have it fill in a template for printing out and posting on a physical job board. 

## Future-Plans
I hope to update this program so that you can insert a company logo in a cell and have it replace a placeholder image in the template, but the functionality is still lacking in Google Apps Script.
If you have any ideas of how to implement images in a program like this, it would be greatly appreciated!
